# raspberry-pi-nord-wifi-ap-tunnel
These scripts are used to set up a raspberry pi as a nordvpn tunnel over wifi connecting to a wan router device but also establishes a wifi ap access point. There are also some scripts for adding samba devices for network attached storage devices...feel free to modify and setup.
